# Welcome to Our New Website

We're excited to announce that the FlowFuse website has been rebuilt using Astro, a modern web framework designed for content-focused websites.

## What's New?

- **Faster Performance**: Astro's island architecture means less JavaScript and faster page loads
- **Modern Styling**: Powered by UnoCSS for efficient, atomic CSS
- **Better Developer Experience**: Easier to maintain and update content

## Why Astro?

Astro is perfect for content-heavy sites like ours. It allows us to:

1. Ship zero JavaScript by default
2. Use content collections for organized blog posts and documentation
3. Optimize images automatically
4. Deploy anywhere with static site generation

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve the FlowFuse experience!
